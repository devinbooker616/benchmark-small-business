        <p>The Lauphitorium is a webstore where you can buy items throughout history that may be seemingly mundane,
            relative to what they are. But what if I told you their history is worth more than what they actually are
            (buying something historiacl because of the history. Crazy right?). On this site you could buy an old style
            telephone. But not just any telephone. It was the first telephone to ever have a prank call come through...
            the pranker? Andrew Jackson. Now you know where that refrigetor joke came from. But that's not all we have,
            you can see more of our fine collection <a href="index.html">here</a>
