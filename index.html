        <h2 style="color: white;">About the Lauphitorium...</h2>
        <p>The Lauphitorium is the funniest website on the net. You can buy items that were used throughout history by
            some pretty famous historical people. These items might seem mundane upon first glance, but a laughable
            description will pique your curiosity to the fullest. One of the many items that I offer, is an old-style
            telephone with a JFK connection that will ring your bell. If you're ready for a shopping adventure like
            none other <a href="landing.html">click here</a> and let the fun begin. I accept all major credit cards,
            apple pay, and paypal.
